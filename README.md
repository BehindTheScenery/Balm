# Forbic

Abstraction Layer (but not really)â„¢ for Blay's multiplatform mods.

I do not recommend other modders to build on this as I will ruthlessly break backwards-compatibility as needed for my mods.

This is a trial run for supporting both Forge and Fabric on my mods, so currently only Waystones depends on this.

If supporting both platforms ends up being viable the rest of my mods will follow.
