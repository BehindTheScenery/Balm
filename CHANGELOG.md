- Updated to Minecraft 1.20
- Hotfix: Fixed crash on Forge when loading mods with configs
- The Fabric version now also loads the config from `waystones-common.toml` (instead of `waystones.toml`)
- `cloth-config` is no longer a hard dependency (but still recommended if you want a config screen)
- Added a fallback for loading custom player data between Forge and Fabric in case of world migrations
