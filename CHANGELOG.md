- Fixed crash when used with Mod Menu / Cloth Config
- Fixed incorrect i18n keys in Cloth Config screen

1.20 Migration Notes:
- The Fabric version now also loads the config from `waystones-common.toml` (instead of `waystones.toml`)
- `cloth-config` is no longer a hard dependency (but still recommended if you want a config screen)
